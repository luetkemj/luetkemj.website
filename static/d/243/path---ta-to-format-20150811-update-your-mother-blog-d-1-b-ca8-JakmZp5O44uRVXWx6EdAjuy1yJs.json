{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>If anyone out there is actually using the Mother Blog plugin I wrote recently for VCU ALT Lab - you should update it with the <a href=\"https://github.com/vcualtlab/motherblog\">newest version</a>.</p>\n<p>FeedWordPress requires that subscribed users have an account on the mother blog. In the signup form we create a list of blogs to choose from based on sites from the network a the current user has accounts on. If we just list all blogs a user is part of we'll get everything - even other motherblogs.</p>\n<p>Having students signup up motherblogs to eachother is a potential cross pollination disaster. </p>\n<p>As of v1.2 the dropdown list will only show sites for which a user is admin. This filters all other mother blogs and for most students will keep the the list to just their own blog.</p>\n<p>So if you are using the Mother Blog plugin on a network install, now would be a good time to update.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Update the Mother Blog plugin to avoid catastrophic cross pollinization. 🐝🐝🐝🐝</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"150811","title":"Update Your Mother Blog","illustration":null}}},"pageContext":{"nextPostPath":"/taToFormat/20150728/mother-blogs-made-better","previousPostPath":"/taToFormat/20150825/vvcreate"}}
