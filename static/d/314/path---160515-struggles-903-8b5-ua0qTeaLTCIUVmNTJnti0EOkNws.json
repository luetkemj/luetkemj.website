I've spent hours watching a very slow paced walk through that has brought lots of insight to the work I did last week. I've gotten pure components working with no problem but really that's just React and React is easy.</p>\n<p>I've been getting a weird error that I can't figure out.</p>\n<pre><code>warning.js:44Warning: Failed propType: Required prop `cardState` was not specified in `CardContainer`. Check the render method of `Connect(CardContainer)`.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Basically, my state that I set up in the reducer isn't making it to my container.</p>\n<p>I've added it to my root reducer.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { combineReducers } from 'redux';\nimport { routerReducer as routing } from 'react-router-redux';\nimport { cardReducer } from './card.reducer';\n\nexport default combineReducers({\n  routing,\n  cardState: cardReducer,\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've set it up as a required propType</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">CardContainer.propTypes = {\n  cardState: PropTypes.object.isRequired,\n  cardActions: PropTypes.object.isRequired,\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>And mapped it to my state.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function mapStateToProps(state) {\n  return {\n    cardState: state.cardState,\n  };\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've followed a pattern that worked on Friday last week so I know I'm just missing some key step or concept but after a weekend of research and trying to get it to work I just can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.</p>\n<p>Beyond the obvious struggle I'm having with redux, I'm also struggling to be patient. I need to remember that I can't learn everything in a weekend. But I can learn it. Just because I'm bad at something now doesn't mean I will always be bad at that thing.</p>\n<p>They say the Redux learning curve is steep but once you get it everything pretty simple. I feel like I'm super close to the top of that curve. Just need to to give it a bit more time.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow I intend to provide a followup with the answer to the question I have tonight.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"160515","title":"Struggles","illustration":null,"layout":"post"}},"allFile":{"edges":[{"node":{"relativePath":"gatsby-icon.png","publicURL":"/static/gatsby-icon-4a9773549091c227cd2eb82ccd9c5e3a.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"gatsby-astronaut.png","publicURL":"/static/gatsby-astronaut-6d91c86c0fde632ba4cd01062fd9ccfa.png"}}]},"nextPost":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/160514/many-hats"}}]},"nextPostMarkdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Many Hats"}},"previousPost":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/160516/module-exports"}}]},"previousPostMarkdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"module.exports"}}},"pageContext":{"nextPostPath":"/160514/many-hats","previousPostPath":"/160516/module-exports"}}
