Excited with my new found knowledge I decided to share it with the world! Looking back I realize that I really did not understand map very well, or at least not well enough to explain it.</p>\n<p>There is a big part of me that wants to delete that post. What if a potential employer sees it! They will see how not smart I am :( This digital trail is a terrible thing… Wait, digital trail?</p>\n<p>If all I leave are the most accurate representations of my current knowledge - wherever that may be - no one will ever see how I grow and learn. As an employee it is vital that I be able to grow in whatever position I have. As an employer it is vital that my coworkers are also able and willing to grow.</p>\n<p>Therefore I will not delete the cringeworthy indecipherable “explanation” of map that I wrote some time ago. Instead, in an effort to showcase the elasticity of my brain I will add to it the latest neat new thing I have learned.</p>\n<p>Curry!</p>\n<p>Much like how the current iteration of who I am today is the amalgamation of all the iterations that came before and to fully understand the who I am today requires that you know who I was yesterday and all the days before... This analogy - much like my attempt to explain map - is going no where. To the code!</p>\n<p>Did you know you can create a function that returns another function that returns another function that returns… …until we have finally built our turtle!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function turtle(name) {\n  return function(part1) {\n    return function(part2) {\n      return function(part3) {\n        return `My turtle's name is ${name}. It has a ${part1}, ${part2}, and a ${part3}.`;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst myTurtle = turtle('Tom')('head')('feet')('shell')\nconsole.log(myTurtle) // My turtle's name is Tom. It has a head, feet, and a shell.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Crazy right?</p>\n<p>But how about in some 1337 es6?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">let turtle = name => part1 => part2 => part3 =>\n    `My turtle's name is ${name}. It has a ${part1}, ${part2}, and a ${part3}.`\n\nconst curriedTurtle = turtle('Tom')('head')('feet')('shell')\nconsole.log(curriedTurtle) // My turtle's name is Tom. It has a head, feet, and a shell.\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"http://codepen.io/luetkemj/pen/qaJOza?editors=0010\">TRY IT!</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"161017","title":"Curry","illustration":null,"layout":"post"}},"allFile":{"edges":[{"node":{"relativePath":"gatsby-icon.png","publicURL":"/static/gatsby-icon-4a9773549091c227cd2eb82ccd9c5e3a.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"gatsby-astronaut.png","publicURL":"/static/gatsby-astronaut-6d91c86c0fde632ba4cd01062fd9ccfa.png"}}]},"nextPost":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/160827/12000-feet"}}]},"nextPostMarkdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"12,000 Feet"}},"previousPost":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/161021/practicing-hardship"}}]},"previousPostMarkdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Practicing Hardship"}}},"pageContext":{"nextPostPath":"/160827/12000-feet","previousPostPath":"/161021/practicing-hardship"}}
